        "value": "The gradient flow and its small flow-time expansion provide a very versatile method to represent renormalized composite operators in a regularization-independent manner. This technique has been utilized to construct typical Noether currents such as the energy\u2013momentum tensor and the axial-vector current in lattice gauge theory. In this paper, we apply the same technique to the supercurrent in the four-dimensional $$\\mathcal{N}=1$$ super Yang\u2013Mills theory (4D $$\\mathcal{N}=1$$ SYM) in the Wess\u2013Zumino gauge. Since this approach provides a priori a representation of the properly normalized conserved supercurrent, our result should be useful, e.g., in lattice numerical simulations of the 4D $$\\mathcal{N}=1$$ SYM; the conservation of the so-constructed supercurrent can be used as a criterion for the supersymmetric point toward which the gluino mass is tuned."
